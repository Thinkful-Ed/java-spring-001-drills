# Drill 5.6 Random Password Generator

Recall drill 2.7 as follows:

> Random password generator: write a program that generates a password using a combination of letters, digits and the punctuations !,@,#,$,%,*,? and _. A password must follow these rules:

>    1. passwords are between 6 and 70 characters long inclusively
>    2. passwords must have at least one upper case letter and at least one lower case letter
>    3. passwords must contain at least one digit and one punctuation

Create a new Spring Boot application using either the Spring Initializr or the Spring Boot CLI. Create a single controller to implement the random password generator. Provide appropriate exception handling and tests for your code.
