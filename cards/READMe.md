# Drill 6.4: Playing Cards

Revisit the Playing Card exercise from drill 4.2. A Deck contains 52 playing cards. Create a new Spring Boot project with a Deck class and a Card class add JPA annotations such that there is a one to many relationship between Deck and Cards. Create a database named **cards** with a database user and connect your application to this database. Examine the generated database schema.
