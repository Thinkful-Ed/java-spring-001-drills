# Playing Cards

Revisit the Playing Card drill from the Programming fundamentals in Java module (you can find the solution to that drill [here](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/java-001-drills/tree/solutions/playing_cards)).

A Deck contains 52 playing cards. Create a new Spring Boot project with a Deck class and a Card class, and add JPA annotations such that there is a one to many relationship between Deck and Cards. Create a database named **cards** with a database user and connect your application to this database. Examine the generated database schema.
