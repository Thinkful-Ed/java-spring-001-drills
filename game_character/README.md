# Game Character Entities - Create a data layer

Revisit the game character classes from the "Dry Up with Inheritance" drill from the Programming fundamentals in Java module. You can  find the solution to the original drill [here](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/java-001-drills/blob/master/dry_up_with_inheritance/README.md).

For this drill:

 - Create a new Spring Boot project and add the classes that were created in the earlier drill.
 - Create a new database named **game** and configure the project to connect to this database. 
 - Annotate the classes as Entities and build the system. 
 - Modify the tests to include the new data layer created.

 Use the pgAdmin tool to examine the database schema that was created.
