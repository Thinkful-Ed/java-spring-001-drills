# Drill 6.1 Game Character Entities - Create a data layer

Revisit the Game Character exercise from drill 4.5. 
 - Create a new Spring Boot project and add the classes that were created in drill 4.5 to the project. 
 - Create a new database named **game** and configure the project to connect to this database. 
 - Annotate the classes as Entities and build the system. 
 - Modify the tests to include the new data layer created.

 Use the pgAdmin tool to examine the database schema that was created.
